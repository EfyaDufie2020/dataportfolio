### 1. Business Intelligence Solutions for Bay Technologies.

In this project, I worked in a team of 6 to analysed the 2019 Sales data for Bay Technologies. The data was sourced from One drive and a database. The objective of this was to design and deliver an end to end business intelligence solutions that analyses the 2019 sales transactional data for Bay Technologies. The data was sourced from One drive and a database. I leveraged on the CRISP-DM methodology which is the standard process for data analysis and answer the business questions of the client: 
-The sales trends.
-Seasonality trends.
-Product performance.
- The top cities that generates more sales.

Recommendations were provided to help the client make data driven decisions to increase sales and improve efficiency.

I collaborated with a team of six data analysts on this project, aiming to integrate datasets from 2018 to 2021 sourced from Microsoft SQL Server, CSV files, and OneDrive. My primary objective was to uncover insights that would attract a new group of investors to India's rapidly growing start-up market. Focusing on key areas that influence investment decisions, my analysis covered:
- Funding Trends
- Sector Analysis
- Series Stage Analysis
- Geographical Analysis
  
Additionally, I identified other promising opportunities within the market. I employed the CRISP-DM method throughout the project.

 In this project, I analyzed a telco customer data to:
 
- Identify Key Indicators of Churn
 Determine the primary factors that influence customers to leave Vodafone, such as service quality, pricing, customer support, and promotional offers. 

- Predict Customer Churn: 
 Develop a predictive model to accurately identify customers at risk of churning, allowing proactive retention efforts. 

- Develop Retention Strategies: 
 Suggest actionable strategies based on the analysis to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty, ultimately reducing churn rates and enhancing Vodafone's revenue and profitability. 

By leveraging advanced data analytics machine learning techniques and CRISP-DM method, I came up with valuable insights to effectively combat customer churn and strengthen their market position.

### 4. Time Regression Analysis

Project Overview: Predicting Sales for a Retail Corporation
This project aims to analyze historical sales data for a retail corporation to predict future sales. The data includes various factors such as store information, product categories, promotions, oil prices, and holiday events. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately forecast sales based on these factors.

The data for this project was collected from various sources, including the retail corporation's database, external datasets (such as oil prices and holiday events), and the Kaggle platform. The data was then cleaned, merged, and transformed to prepare it for analysis.

Exploratory data analysis was performed to understand the structure, distribution, and relationships of the data. This included univariate and bivariate analysis, as well as visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and time series plots.

New features were created from the existing data to improve the model's performance. This included extracting information from the date column, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated to predict sales. The models considered include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting. The models were evaluated using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared.

## Model Selection and Deployment

Based on the evaluation results, the gradient boosting model was selected as the best performing model. The model was then deployed to make predictions on new data.

## Future Work

The project can be further extended by incorporating additional factors such as weather data, customer demographics, and market trends. Additionally, the model can be fine-tuned and improved by using techniques such as hyperparameter tuning and ensemble methods.
